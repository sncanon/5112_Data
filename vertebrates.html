     <h1>NUMBERS OF THREATENED SPECIES<br></h1>
       <h2>BY MAJOR GROUPS OF ORGANISMS (1996â€“2017)</h2>
     <p textcolor="white">Changes in number of threatened species from year to year should not be directly interpreted as trends in the status of biodiversity. The figures displayed below reflect increased assessment efforts by IUCN and its Partners over time, rather than genuine changes in numbers of threatened species. For a clearer view of genuine trends in the status of biodiversity please refer to the IUCN Red List Index (see the section
Trends in the status of biodiversity on the IUCN Red List web site: <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/summary-statistics#TrendsInBiodiversityStatus" target=blank>http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/summary-statistics#TrendsInBiodiversityStatus</a>).</p>

      <p><strong>NOTES</strong>
        <ol type="1">
<li> The sources used for the numbers of described species in each taxonomic group are listed below.
<li> Threatened species are those listed as Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN) or Vulnerable (VU).
<li> Where  less than 80% of species within a group have been evaluated, figures for % threatened species are not provided because there is insufficient coverage for these groups. It is only possible to provide reliable figures for % threatened species for those groups that are completely or almost completely evaluated (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians and gymnosperms).
  <li>The percentage of threatened species can be calculated for those groups that are completely or almost completely evaluated (>80% of species evaluated), but the actual number of threatened species is often uncertain because it is not known whether Data Deficient (DD) species are actually threatened or not. Therefore, a range of percentages is provided: lower estimate = % threatened extant species (if all DD species are not threatened); best estimate = % threatened extant species (if DD species are equally threatened as data sufficient species); upper estimate = % threatened extant species (if all DD species are threatened). If a single figure is required for reporting purposes, the best estimate figure should be used.
    <li>The number of described and evaluated mammals excludes domesticated species like sheep (Ovis aries), goats (Capra hircus), Dromedary (Camelus dromedarius), etc.
      <li>Crustaceans include six classes: Malacostraca (crabs, lobsters, shrimp, woodlice, etc.); Branchiopoda (fairy shrimp, clam shrimp, etc.); Cephalocardia (horseshoe shrimp); Ostracoda (seed shrimp); Maxillopoda (barnacles, copepods, etc.); and Remipedia (remipedes)
        <li>The plant numbers DO NOT include species from the 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants (Walter and Gillett 1998) as those were all assessed using the pre-1994 IUCN system of threat categorization. Hence the numbers of of threatened plants are very much lower when compared to the 1997 results. The results from this Red List and the 1997 Plants Red List should be combined together when reporting on threatened plants.
<li>Mosses include the true mosses (Bryophyta), the hornworts (Anthoceratophyta), and liverworts (Marchantiophyta).
  <li>The ferns and allies include club mosses and spike mosses (Lycopodiopsida), quillworts (Isoetopsida), horsetails (Equisetopsida) and ferns (Marattiopsida, Polypodiopsida and Psilotopsida).
    <li>Seaweeds are included in the green algae (Chlorophyta, Charophyta), red algae (Rhodophyta), and brown algae (Ochrophyta or Heterokontophyta).</li>
